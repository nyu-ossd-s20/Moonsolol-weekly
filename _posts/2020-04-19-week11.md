title: Week 11

Coronavirus has had a massive effect on our daily lifestyles at this point. We are attending classes through Zoom, we can't freely go outside to shop or have fun, and the news is exploding with news related to the virus, and barely anything else. However, people all over the world are working at this very moment to help control and collect data relating to the Coronavirus in hopes of improving community understanding.
For our classes, we looked into and researched various open-source coronavirus projects that are currently on the web, and explained and talked about what we found. It was surprising how all of us managed to each find a completely different project, with no duplicates. So many people are working hard to raise awareness and keep people safe, and I hope that they will continue to do so.
