title: Week 10
---

This week, the groups in our class did stand-up reports on what projects everyone planned to work on and progress/details.  My group is planning on working on OpenFoodFacts. It seems to be a site/platform that is very easy and simple to contribute to, and has interesting sets of data that appeal to the members of my group. In addition, the website itself does not exactly look very up-to-par, which means that we an also potentially work on improving the UI and performance of the website itself.

Editing Wikipedia has been a novel experience. Often times, articles already have enough data and sources that there is no need to contribute to further, or would be too much work to do so. As a result, I had to go to articles that are more niche, which makes it more potentially empty/in-need-of-contribution. I decided to pick some articles that fell into my interest range, and added minor edits to those.
