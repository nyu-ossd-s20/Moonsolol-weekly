The lecture from invited speakers Gil Yehuda was very interesting to listen to. He talked a lot about real world applications of open source that many of us were not expecting. He also talked about the technology behind open source projects, and how contributions are to be made. Overall, it was an enlightening experience.

In addition, this week we covered Eric Raymond's "The Cathedral and the Bazaar" essay, which is about good guidelines to follow as a programmer, and as one who delves into open-source projects. Many of the guidelines may come in useful in my future career, like treating beta testers as co-developers, and thinking of data structures as paramount. It is something that I will continue to keep in my mind for the future.
