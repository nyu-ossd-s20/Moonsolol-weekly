While the world has had an extremely hectic month due to Coronavirus, with NYU moving to remove classes for the rest of the month and most of April, I was still able to progress in my Open Source studies during such a time. On Monday, we had gone over our possible plans for what open-source project we would be interested in contributing to. On Wednesday, we were to form groups during class and plan to see which project we would like to work on together. Unfortunately, due to the epidemic, classes were not able to be physically attended. However, via NYU Zoom, we were still able to hold our class session from our residences.

In our groups, we privately worked and conversed together in picking an open source project to contribute to later in the semester. Although one of our group memebers was not able to join us, we managed to work through several suggestions before settling for Open Food Facts, and open-source database of food products, showing nutritional values and more with the help of a constantly contributing userbase. However, there is still a chance that we will switch projects, and we will continue to converse about our decision over the next couple of weeks.
