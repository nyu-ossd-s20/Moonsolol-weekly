For our open source project, my group has created a wiki page on Github that lists our contributions. We had all done work with Free Code Camp, and now we could record what we had done. In addition, we continued looking through pull requests and helping each other with issues that we could help out with together.
During class, we went over Free Open Source Software Business Models. It was interesting to learn about a lot of the history behind OSS and various examples of different businesses using and creating various open source softwares that we use in our daily life.
